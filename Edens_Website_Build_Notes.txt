1. Filled the head element with what I understand to be the necessary elements.
 
2. There is an html template now called "skinny_panda_html_template" and saved 
in Design_Guide_Assets

3. There are 5 pages already created: "edenshome", "abouteden", "edensservicees", 
"recruitment" and "contacteden"

4. WE ARE STARTING WITH "abouteden" AND "edensservices" IN TERMS OF 
FULL HTML BUILD.

5. Building an ACCORDION for edensservices.html using this site as our guide: 
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp
Apparently they are considered to be buttons. As opposed to list items <li></li>
Apparently I am also entering the world of JavaScript and JQuery with this 
Accordion thing.
